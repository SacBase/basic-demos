 *   This file is to give an overview of the SAC demo programs of this
 *   directory.
 *   
 *   The directory comes with a Makefile that contains pattern rules
 *   for making executables from SAC-source files. Therefore each of the
 *   demo programs <name>.sac can be compiled by simply running (GNU-)
 *   "make <name>". The pattern rules provided even comprise an implicit
 *   dependency-checking system. It makes sure that any module needed for
 *   the compilation of a particular program will be compiled on beforehand.

SAC demo modules and classes:
=============================


1) List.dec / src/List/*.[ch]

The C module List naively implements cons-lists on integer numbers in C.
In order to properly handle the memory management involved, the C-code
makes use of some macros of the SAC runtime system such as SAC_MALLOC,
SAC_ND_KS_DEC_OUT_RC, SAC_ND_KS_DEC_IN_RC as can be seen in the C source
files in src/List/*.[ch]. 
This is indicated to the sac2c compiler by proper refcounting - pragmas
in the declaration file List.dec.

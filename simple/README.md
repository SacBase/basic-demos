SAC demo programs
=================


## `gcd.sac`

This SAC demo program is meant as a very basic, introductory example.
It prints the greatest common denominator of 22 and 27. The main objective
of this program is to demonstrate the similarity between SAC and C programs.
Furthermore, it makes use of some minor extensions introduced in SAC for
convenience reasons, e.g. omitted type declarations or multiple return values.

## `inssort.sac`

This SAC program contains an implementation of the insertion sort algorithm.
Once again, the program looks strikingly similar to a C or Java implementation.


## `fibonacci.sac`

Three versions of the Fibonacci function in `SaC`.

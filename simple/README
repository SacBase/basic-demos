 *   
 *   The directory comes with a Makefile that contains pattern rules
 *   for making executables from SAC-source files. Therefore each of the
 *   demo programs <name>.sac can be compiled by simply running (GNU-)
 *   "make <name>". The pattern rules provided even comprise an implicit
 *   dependency-checking system. It makes sure that any module needed for
 *   the compilation of a particular program will be compiled on beforehand.

SAC demo programs:
==================


1) gcd.sac

This SAC demo program is ment as a very basic, introductory example.
It prints the greatest common denominator of 22 and 27. The main objective
of this program is to demonstrate the similarity between SAC and C programs.
Furthermore, it makes use of some minor extensions introduced in SAC for
convenience reasons, e.g. omited type declarations or multiple return values.

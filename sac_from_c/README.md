In the absence of a proper documentation of the sac_from_c foreign
language interface, here is a very simple usage example.

Next to the SAC compiler sac2c the interface requires a special
tool called sac4c that comes with the SAC installation.

The general procedure is as follows:

1. Create a SAC module (.sac file)
2. Compile that module (.a and two .so files)
3. Call sac4c on the SAC module (generates another .so file and a header file)
4. Compile your c program
5. Link everything
6. Run

Also consult the Makefile in this directory for more information
on how to properly call the tools.
